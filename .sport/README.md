# Welcome to the "sport"!
https://github.com/modularizer/sport

> a sport template built from the geet-soccer-app

## QUICKSTART
```bash
npm install -g geet-geet
geet install modularizer/sport MyApp --private
```


## Working with geet templates
This template was created with [geet](https://github.com/modularizer/geet),
a CLI git wrapper which acts as an alternative to git submodules,
allowing publishing a template which controls files which are interleaved in the same working directory as your project.

### Benefits of `geet`
- Pull template updates when you want, receiving fixes straight into your project
- Modify the template source code in your working directory! If you diverge, conflicts will be resolved cleanly without messing up your files
- Push updates and fixes back to the template repo to improve it for other users
- Cleanly detach some or all files from the template at any time

## Things to know:
1. Typically, **template files get double-tracked**
    - They get pulled into your working directory and tracked by YOU
    - They ALSO are tracked by the remote template repo
    - If and when you wish, you can pull updates from the template repo into your project and add and commit the files into your repo
    - If you are a developer/contributor of the template repo, you can optionally push code back to the template repo using a different git command
2. Once your local state diverges enough to get conflicts, template files will merge on `geet pull` by writing to an untracked file like `index.template.ts` instead of `index.ts`
3. `geet` is the suggested entrypoint for all your pull/push git-like commands. It protects you and adds some features. More on that later.
4. Refer to [geet docs](https://github.com/modularizer/geet) for more info
